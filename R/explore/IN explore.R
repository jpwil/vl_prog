# Treatments and Interventions Domain

# "An interventions domain that contains concomitant and prior medications used 
# by the subject, such as those given on an as needed basis or condition-appropriate
# medications (Concomitant and Prior Medications Domain).â€‹ An interventions domain 
# that contains the details of a subject's exposure to protocol-specified study 
# treatment. Study treatment may be any intervention that is prospectively defined
# as a test material within a study, and is typically but not always supplied to 
# the subject (Exposure Domain). An interventions domain that contains information
# about protocol-specified study treatment administrations, as collected (Exposure
# as Collected Domain). One record per recorded intervention occurrence per 
# subject."
